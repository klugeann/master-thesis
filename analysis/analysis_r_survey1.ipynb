The difference in prices seems reasonable considering the online shop's pricing policies and the fact that my friend and I purchased on the same day.                                                                    | 6 - Although it's frustrating to pay more for a similar item, considering we bought at the same time, I try to be understanding of online pricing fluctuations.                                                                                                                 | 4 - It seems like an error on the part of the online shop, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt this time.                                                                                                                                  | ⋯ | 5 - Knowing I bought a black smartphone from this shop could help them identify me, but it's not extremely sensitive since most people buy different colors.                                                                                                                                                               | 2 - My location is publicly available through my IP address or device settings, but I'm not aware of this shop using it to personalize prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 6 - While they already knew my purchase details, using my past browsing behavior could be seen as a bit invasive and potentially sensitive, but it's still a relatively common practice in online shopping.                                                                                                                                   | 6 - Knowing my past purchases from this shop might seem slightly invasive, but it's likely they're just trying to offer me better deals and services based on my purchase history.                                                                                                                                                                      | 6 - Sharing my social media data could be considered somewhat invasive, but many online shops and services collect this type of data anyway, so it's not entirely unexpected.                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2 - I'm not comfortable sharing my device details with a marketer unless it's absolutely necessary for them to offer me a better deal or service.                                                                                                                                                            | 3 - While I'm generally open with online shops about my location for delivery and other purposes, I wouldn't want to share it just for personalized price discrimination.                                                                                                                                                       | 4 - While some marketers might use this data, I'm not entirely comfortable sharing my browsing history unless it's explicitly stated that they'll use it for better customer service or offers.                                                                                                                                                         | 4 - I'm somewhat willing to share my past shopping history if it means getting better deals or rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 4 -
