You are participating at a research study on consumer pricing perceptions. You have decided to buy a new smartphone. In the course of an extensive online research, you have informed yourself and decided to buy in an online shop you know from previous research.  You are are familiar with the product features and with the typical market price which can range from 80 – 120 $ for a smartphone with the same features. You have a specific budget for this purchase and your preferences are influenced by the price. 
Now imagine that you have bought the offer as shown below. Please take a moment and have a look at the product. 
You have bought a black Smartphone for the price of $100.
You will be given a scenario about online shopping and will then answer a series of survey questions. Please respond as if you were a real online shopper experiencing the scenario. This scenario is part of an experiment where the price variation you see may be affected by pricing strategies in the store, and this pricing is manipulated randomly as part of the study. 
You learn that your close friend bought the same smartphone from the same online shop. The price your friend paid is either the same, higher, or lower than yours.
You are being asked to respond as if you were a real online shopper, experiencing this situation. Answer honestly and based on how you would feel in the given situation. 
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING:

- Each question has a specific response format.
